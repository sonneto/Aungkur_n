			Aungkur believes that the development goal can only be achieved if both men & women regardless of class, religion, ethnicity and race can be involved in the development process particularly rural poor women need special attention and should be trained and motivated to participate in development process for social and economic empowerment. Gender Development Program aims to achieve equity, rather than equality by formulating policies, procedures and budgets for mainstreaming the gender issues in organization level. In order to ensure equality between men & women, public awareness of women’s rights and empower the women, the organization will provide training, workshop, seminars and supporting women’s organization & women-focused programs undertaking women’s participation in productive economic activities and in the development process.
