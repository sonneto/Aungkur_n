It is an essential element for investing people in order to develop their capacity and capability to access & manage resources, concretization of people, and building of their institution. It is a major key component of Aungkur programs which threads together all its activities to make them an integrated whole. Since the problem of poverty in Bangladesh is structural in nature, any development action should attempt to bring about a change in the prevailing unjust social structures. In view of this reality, the Human Resource Development programmes of Aungkur cover a wide range of intertwined social issues and practical skill themes reflecting all the programmes.</p>
