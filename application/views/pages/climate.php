			The organization of your writing wi fa-lgll determine whether or not a reader will understand and bepersuaded by your argument. Brilliant rhetoric will only carry you so far—if your piece does not follow a clear structure, many of your points will be lost or misunderstood. As a result, it is crucial that your writing follow a clear organizational format that will be intelligible to your reader.

			Most legal writing requires the writer to analyze a set of facts using legal rules gleaned from amyriad of sources, including cases, statutes, and secondary materials. Unlike the non-legal writingyou’ve done in college and at work, legal writing has its own specific structure that lawyerseverywhere use in one form or another—and which they expect to see in your written work.Whether they call it IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion), CRAC (Conclusion, Rule,Application, Conclusion), or CREAC (Conclusion, Rule, Explanation, Application, Conclusion), alllawyers write in the same way: by laying out the issue to be discussed, the legal rule relevant to theissue, the analysis of the pertinent facts based on that rule, and the overall conclusion reached.
