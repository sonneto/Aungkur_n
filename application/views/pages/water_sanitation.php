			<p class="paragraphstyle w3-large">Aungkur is committed to implement programs relating to safe drinking water sanitation for improvement of health status of the community people. In Bangladesh, one of the main reasons for child death, ill health & high mortality is lack of safe water & sanitation facilities for the rural unprivileged & disadvantaged people. Aungkur is trying to reach these people with accessible, affordable and sustainable water supply & sanitation facilities through integrated hardware & software programs. Arsenic problems have become severe in Madaripur & neighboring district causing panic among community people.
			Aungkur has taken up various arsenic mitigation programs to disseminate basic knowledge and information among community about serious problems of arsenicosis and how to get rid of this problem and provide treatment and support services to arsenic affected patient on a community based development approach.
