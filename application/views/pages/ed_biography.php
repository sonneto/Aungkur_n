			Md. Ayub Ali Talukder was born in 1956 in the village Sreenathdi under Kendua union of Sadar Upazila of Madaripur District of Bangladesh. His father late Hazi Babaon Talukder was a famous  jute trader and socially respected person in the locality. He graduated in 1976 from Nazimuddin College, Madaripur under Dhaka University. During his student life in Nazimuddin College he was involved in development activities of BRDB and was greatly influenced by the social development activities of a neighboring NGO GUP ( Gono Unnayan Prochesta). Since them the dream of doing social work particularly for the development of deprived, oppressed and socially neglected poor people of rural areas was rooted in his mind. 
			<br>
			<br>

			In such a situation suddenly there appeared the opportunity. In 1977 he got the desired chance to work with Proshika human development Center, a  renowned national level NGO in the then Bangladesh. In his long service life in Proshika he performed his duties & responsibilities very successfully and earned a lot of fame and  reputation in the development work. At the same time the got the opportunity to work with grass root level helpless poor people of very remote rural areas of various districts of Bangladesh. He had the opportunity to observe and analyze the socio-economic condition of these people from a very close distance and witnessed the rise & fall, weal & woe, smiles & tears, helplessness & ignorance of these poor rural people. He put an end of his variegated service life at Proshika in 1986. 
			<br>
			<br>


			He immediately joined IVDC, a reputed NGO and performed duties at different positions of the organization. He had to travel to the doors of disadvantaged poor people  to provide services to these neglected & oppressed people of different districts of Bangladesh and increased his experience to a great height. He gave up the job of  IVDC in 1991 after gaining a lot of practical experience & profound knowledge in development work. 

			<br>
			<br>
			
			He realized deeply that it is necessary to work whole heartedly for socio-economic development of disadvantaged people. His main source of inspiration & encouragement in engaging himself in the service of mankind is his hard-earned experience & vast knowledge in development work. For materializing his long cherished desire he established Aungkur Palli Unnayan Kendra in 1989 and got it registered under Department of Social Welfare in 1992. Since the registration of Aungkur Palli Unnayan Kendra he has been trying to change the socio economic condition of disadvantaged community people through adoption and implementation of programs relating  to Human Rights, Good Governance, Human Resource Development, Ecological Environment, Women Development, Ecological Agriculture, Employment Generation, Watsan, Primary Health and Nutrition, Civic Awareness, Primary Education and School Sanitation. Many local and Foreign Donors provided financial assistance in implementing development programs of Aungkur Palli Unnayan Kendra. The main donor agencies are; APHD, CORDAID (BILANCE), SAP-Bangladesh, CANADA High Commission, BRAC, PROSHIKA, NGO Forum, VERC, European Commission, The Lamp Foundation, SIMAVI, The Max Foundation, Wilde Ganzen, LGED.
