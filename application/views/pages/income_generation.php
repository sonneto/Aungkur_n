			<p class="paragraphstyle w3-large">All of Aungkurâ€™s Development endeavors revolve round economic emancipation of the poor because economic bondage often restricts the other aspects of development. Specially, poor women folk are doubly burdened. Therefore, alternative modes of development need to be devised for the empowerment of the poor section which will allow them to overcome the prevalent inequitable system quite effectively. Self- employment provides a significant opportunity in this regard. The Income and employment generating activities of Aungkur facilitate this self-employment process to make the poor people economically self-reliant and help them to attain a respectable social standing.<br><br>
			It is provided with sustainable credit supports and professional development training to the primary group members in order to access to financial market and to upgrade their family level income. The program aims to alleviate poverty through income generation and human resource development & self-employment creation.
